  <h1>About the Project</h1>

  <p>
    Diabetes is one of the most common non-communicable diseases in India, with
    a large number of people remaining undiagnosed. Tamil Nadu has a particularly
    high burden of diabetes and pre-diabetes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our project focuses on HbA1c testing, which reflects average blood sugar levels
    over the past three months and helps identify individuals at risk early.
  </p>

  <h2>Why HbA1c?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Does not require fasting</li>
    <li>More reliable than random blood sugar</li>
    <li>Useful for early detection</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    We are a team of four high school students from Coimbatore working under
    the guidance of NGOs and healthcare professionals.
